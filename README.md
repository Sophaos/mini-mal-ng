# Mini-MAL

A minimal version of MyAnimeList built with Angular using the JIKAN API to visualize upcoming anime and manga, as well as their details.

You can access the live web app here: [Mini-MAL-NG Web App](https://sophaos-mini-mal-ng.netlify.app/home)

## Motivation

My motivation was to build an application using Redux in Angular with a public API to view the details of anime and manga, similar to MyAnimeList, using the principles of reactive programming.

## What I've learned

- Practiced with Angular 16 (without Signals) and RxJS (reactive programming)
- Manipulated an external API to retrieve and display information
- Applied the principles of Redux using NgRx's store, effects, and router-store
- Utilized PrimeNG components
- Used the PrimeFlex CSS utility library for application visuals, ensuring compliance with responsive web design

## What I've used

- Angular
- TypeScript
- SCSS
- RxJS
- PrimeNG
- PrimeFlex
- NgRx

## How to run

Run the following command: `docker compose up`

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
