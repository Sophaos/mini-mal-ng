This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.4.

## Motivation

My motivation was to build an application using Redux in Angular with a public API to view the details of anime and manga, similar to MyAnimeList, using the principles of reactive programming.

## What I've learned

- Practiced with Angular 16 (without Signals) and RxJS (reactive programming)
- Manipulated an external API to retrieve and display information
- Applied the principles of Redux using NgRx's store, effects, and router-store
- Utilized PrimeNG components
- Used the PrimeFlex CSS utility library for application visuals, ensuring compliance with responsive web design

## What I've used

- Angular
- TypeScript
- SCSS
- RxJS
- PrimeNG
- PrimeFlex
- NgRx

## How to run

Run the following command: `docker compose up`

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
